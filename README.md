# Swift-Programming-Language

SWIFT, is a combination of high-level programming language. SWIFT is a simple, but Turing complete , programming language. A SWIFT program must be wholly-contained in a single source file named with the extension .swift. SWIFT is a very strongly-typed  language which supports

1. explicitly defined variables and constants with data types integer, character, boolean, and string; 
2. integer, character, boolean, and string variables and constants structured as scalars
3. integer, character, and boolean variables (but no string variables and no constants of any data type) structured as one-dimensional  associative arrays ;
4. literals for each of the scalar data types integer, character, boolean, and string;
5. statically-allocated global scope and program module local scope variables and constants; 
6. an eclectic list of unary and binary operators;
    6.1	Unary may include
        6.1.1 The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
        6.1.2 The unary minus (-) operator.
        6.1.3 The logical not (!) operator.
    6.2 Binary may include
        6.2.1 addition (+) operator,
        6.2.2 subtraction (-) operator
        6.2.3 division (/) operator.
7. a multiple-assignment statement;
8. several flow-of-control statements (a “standard” pretest FOR loop statement, a very interesting midtest DO-WHILE-DO loop statement, a standard IF statement, but no GOTO statement and no statement labels);
9. PRINT and INPUT statements for interactive text input/output;
10. non-recursive and recursive calls of function and procedure subprogram modules (accomplished with an expression-resident prefix function referencing syntax, a CALL statement, and a RETURN statement);
11. a simplistic form of exception handling (accomplished with handler subprogram modules and a RAISE, an EXIT, and a RESUME statement).
