# Swift-Programming-Language

SWIFT, is a combination of high-level programming language. SWIFT is a simple, but Turing complete , programming language. A SWIFT program must be wholly-contained in a single source file named with the extension .swift. SWIFT is a very strongly-typed  language which supports

•	explicitly defined variables and constants with data types integer, character, boolean, and string; 
•	integer, character, boolean, and string variables and constants structured as scalars
•	integer, character, and boolean variables (but no string variables and no constants of any data type) structured as one-dimensional associative arrays ;
•	literals for each of the scalar data types integer, character, boolean, and string;
•	statically-allocated global scope and program module local scope variables and constants; 
•	an eclectic list of unary and binary operators;
o	Unary may include
	The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
	The unary minus (-) operator.
	The logical not (!) operator.
o	Binary may include
	addition (+) operator, 
	subtraction (-) operator
	division (/) operator.
•	a multiple-assignment statement;
•	several flow-of-control statements (a “standard” pretest FOR loop statement, a very interesting midtest DO-WHILE-DO loop statement, a standard IF statement, but no GOTO statement and no statement labels);
•	PRINT and INPUT statements for interactive text input/output;
•	non-recursive and recursive calls of function and procedure subprogram modules (accomplished with an expression-resident prefix function referencing syntax, a CALL statement, and a RETURN statement);
•	a simplistic form of exception handling (accomplished with handler subprogram modules and a RAISE, an EXIT, and a RESUME statement).
